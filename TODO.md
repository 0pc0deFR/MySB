## rTorrent

- add timestamp for every annoncer check and compare with the previous check _(don't check for < 1 day)_
- add boolean on portal for activate/deactivate annoncer check + add tooltip for the time processing
- maybe execute annoncer check _(GetTrackersCert.bsh)_ in other process to not block the addition of new torrent
